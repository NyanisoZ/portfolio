                <h3>My portfolio website</h3>
                <p>The genesis of my front-end journey has manifested in this website. It's not only my 184th or so attempt at a 'website' this year, it's a living, breathing body of work that is continuously growing and getting better with every new line of code I add and update I make. Explore, click around, and remember, this is only the beginning of the web revolution!</p>

                <p>I got thie idea for a random quote generator from freecodecamp.org, a popular online source of knowledge on all things 'programming'. Initially it was
                    going to be just that, 'random quotes', but then I thought, "Where's the fun in that?" and so as you might guess I played around with it and ended up with The popular Author, Academic and Clinical Psychologist, Jordan Peterson as my focal point</p>

                <h3>My Weather App</h3>
                <p>Thanks to this amazing piece of software called API's (Application programming Interface) I was finally able to put finally put together a weather app after what seemed like an eternity of frustration and a broken laptop screen.
